This application classifies Tweets as sentiments.  The application connects the data feed of Twitter and collects batches of Tweets in real time and in interval specified by the user. The data is preprocessed by removing stop words and making all text lowercase using Python's Natural Language Processing Toolkit and Pyspark for parallel processing. A Naïve Bayes classification model (from Python’s NLTK package) is used on these batches of Tweets. The total number of positive and negative Tweets for every batch is counted.
